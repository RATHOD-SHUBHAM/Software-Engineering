## Scope & Feasibility study

  ### Scope: 

   It’s important to outline the scope of the project so that you can determine the scope of the feasibility study. The project’s scope will include the number and composition of both internal stakeholders and external clients or customers.

  ### Conducting a feasibility study will typically include:

  - Preliminary analysis: The preliminary analysis aims to uncover insurmountable obstacles that would render a feasibility study useless. If no major roadblocks are uncovered during this pre-screen, a more intensive feasibility study will be conducted.

  - Market research: The feasibility study will determine whether there is a viable place for the project within that market.

  - Financial assessment: The feasibility study will examine the economic costs related to the project, including equipment or other resources, man-hours, the proposed benefits of the project, the break-even schedule, the financial risks, and — most importantly — the potential financial impact of the project’s failure.

  - Roadblocks and alternative solutions: Should any potential problems surface during the study, it will look at solutions for the project to go ahead successfully.

  - Final decision: The final aspect of a feasibility study is the recommended course of action—in other words, whether the project should proceed or not.

## Cocomo (Constructive Cost Model).

  Cocomo is a regression model based on LOC, i.e number of Lines of Code. It is a procedural cost estimate model for software projects and often used as a process of reliably predicting the various parameters associated with making a project such as size, effort, cost, time and quality.

## Software Development Methodologies:

  ### Waterfall methodology

  - Waterfall Model methodology which is also known as Liner Sequential Life Cycle Model. Waterfall Model followed in the sequential order, and so project development team only moves to next phase of development or testing if the previous step completed successfully.

  ### Agile methodology.

  - Agile methodology is a practice that helps continuous iteration of development and testing in the software development process. In this model, development and testing activities are concurrent, unlike the Waterfall model. This process allows more communication between customers, developers, managers, and testers.

## Microsoft Project Software.

   Microsoft Project (MSP) is a project management software made for project management so as to control projects. Depending on the plan.

   In this Project, Microsoft Project planner was used to plan projects, assign tasks, manage resources, and make reports.
