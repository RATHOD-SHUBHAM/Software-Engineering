## Scope & Feasibility study
  ### Scope: 
    It’s important to outline the scope of the project so that you can determine the scope of the feasibility study. The project’s scope will include the number and composition of both internal stakeholders and external clients or customers.

  ### Conducting a feasibility study will typically include:
      - Preliminary analysis: The preliminary analysis aims to uncover insurmountable obstacles that would render a feasibility study useless. If no major roadblocks are uncovered during this pre-screen, a more intensive feasibility study will be conducted.
      - Market research: The feasibility study will determine whether there is a viable place for the project within that market.
      - Financial assessment: The feasibility study will examine the economic costs related to the project, including equipment or other resources, man-hours, the proposed benefits of the project, the break-even schedule, the financial risks, and — most importantly — the potential financial impact of the project’s failure.
      - Roadblocks and alternative solutions: Should any potential problems surface during the study, it will look at solutions for the project to go ahead successfully.
      - Final decision: The final aspect of a feasibility study is the recommended course of action—in other words, whether the project should proceed or not.
